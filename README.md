## Usage
* Instance it in your scene
* The Canvas is an extension of [TextureButton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texturebutton.html?highlight=textureButton) and uses [Line2D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_line2d.html?highlight=line2d) for drawing. 
* The drawing line can be edited and some examples are given.
* The canvas with background can be adjusted with a different color.
* The optimized canvas captures the screen and uses that as the texture of the Canvas. Then the lines are freed, to decrease drawing cost.
* Note for less strenuous drawing with mouse and trackpad, you could enable toggle mode.
